# vite-react-router-v7-template
This template is a boilerplate project designed to kickstart web applications using Vite for fast development, React for building dynamic user interfaces, and React Router v7 for seamless client-side navigation.

# React + Vite + React Router v7

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules along with routing.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
